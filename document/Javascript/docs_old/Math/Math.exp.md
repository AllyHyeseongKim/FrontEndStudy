#Math.exp
The Math.exp() function returns ex, where x is the argument, and e is Euler's constant, the base of the natural logarithms.



#### 문법

```javascript
Math.exp(x)
```

#### 전달인자

x
A number.


#### 설명

Because exp() is a static method of Math, you always use it as Math.exp(), rather than as a method of a Math object you created (Math is not a constructor).



#### 예

```javascript
Math.exp(-1); // 0.36787944117144233
Math.exp(0);  // 1
Math.exp(1);  // 2.718281828459045
```
